OpenVPN 3 Linux VPN Client devposture service
---------------------------------------------

:Manual section: 8
:Manual group: OpenVPN 3 Linux

SYNOPSIS
========
| ``openvpn3-service-devposture`` ``[OPTIONS]``
| ``openvpn3-service-devposture`` ``-h`` | ``--help``


DESCRIPTION
===========
The ``openvpn3-service-devposture`` process is a backend service for OpenVPN 3
Linux, reponsible for retrieving client environment information, such as OS
details (distro, version, etc.) and presenting it to ``openvpn3-service-client``
upon request.

``openvpn3-service-client`` then forwards this to the peer during connection
attempts. The peer can then veto the client based on the received information.

Beware that running this with another user account than *@OPENVPN_USERNAME@* also requires
updating the D-Bus policy as well.


OPTIONS
=======

-h, --help      Print  usage and help details to the terminal

--version       Prints the version of the program and exists

--log-level LEVEL
                Sets the default log verbosity for log events generated by
                this service.  The default is :code:`3`.  Valid values are
                :code:`0` to :code:`6`.  Higher log levels results in more
                verbose logs and log level :code:`6` will contain all debug
                log events.

                This setting will be overridden if the configuration file
                used contains the ``--verb`` option (see the ``openvpn``\(8)
                man page for details) or the ``log-level`` configuration profile
                override has been set (see ``openvpn3-config-manage``\(1)).

--log-file LOG_DESTINATION
                By default, logging will go via the ``openvpn3-service-log``
                service.  By providing this argument, logging will also be sent
                to *LOG_DESTINATION*, which can be either a filename or
                :code:`stdout:` where the latter one sends log data to the
                console.

--colour
                This will add colours to log events when logging to file
                or terminal.  Log events will be coloured based on the log
                level of the event.

--idle-exit MINUTES
                The ``openvpn3-service-devposture`` service will exit
                automatically if it is being idle for *MINUTES* minutes.

--profile-dir DIRECTORY
                Directory containing the Device Posture Protocol profile
                definitions.  These files instructs the device posture service
                how to respond to various device posture check requests by
                the VPN server.  The default directory is
                ``@DEVPOSTURE_PROFILEDIR@``.
